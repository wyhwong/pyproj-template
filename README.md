# Template for Python Project

A template for Python projects. It utilizes [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management and packaging, and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization. It also uses [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) for automation of common tasks, and multiple tools for development (for details you may check [README.md](./src/README.md)).

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wyhwong/pyproj-template.git
cd pyproj-template
```

See [README.md](./src/README.md) for more details.
